            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented language. It is a small and lightweigh
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected
                to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set
                of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its 
                    Document Object model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                    on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, fom input, and page navigation. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the coe language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
                    server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide 
                    continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations 
                    on a server.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language 
                resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
                syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to 
                JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast too Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based 
                on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object
                model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, 
                what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript als supports functions without any special declarative requirements. 
                Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You
                do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. 
                Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <h2>Hello world</h2>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) {
                    alert("Hello " + yourName);
                }
                greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <p>Select the code in he pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
